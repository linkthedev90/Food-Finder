# Food Finder
 Recipe Finder app powered by Java Springboot
This is a Web Application I wrote that uses a food API ( provided by https://spoonacular.com/food-api ) to return items that match the Users search terms. The User can then click on a item to be taken to it's recipe page.

You can access the app here - 

### Features
## Recipe Search By Title
- With the title search button selected, enter a search term to return up to 3 items that include the term in there name example - searching "Blueberry" can return "Blueberry Cheesecake" , "Blueberry Crisp" & "Blueberry Raspberry Pie"

## Search By Ingredients
- With the ingredient search button selected, enter an ingredient that is included with a recipe that your looking for. This is great if you don't know what to make, but have lose ingredients in your fridge. ex - adding tags "sugar" & "milk" can return "Lemon Ricotta Pancakes" & "Parmesan Cheddar Brioche"
